\section{Getting the Application}


Note that do not need to have actual hardware or any drivers
installed to run and play with the software.

EazyCNC is distributed via Internet so just download the file
appropriate for your operating system from the EazyCNC website
at:

http://www.eazycnc.com/downloads/downloads.php

Depending on your operating system EazyCNC is distributed as
a compressed file which you may have to un-compress with the
tools in you operating system.

\section{Installing the Application}

EazyCNC comes as a single executable file which does not
require an installer. Just copy the file to where ever you
want in your computers hard disk. 

If you prefer you can create a shortcut aka alias for the
application and put it on the Start Menu or Desktop or drag the icon into the Dock.



To launch the application just double click on the file. 
Note that after clicking at the icon ,it takes a while
before you see the EazyCNC main screen, especially on the
first launch. If you are impatient and launch the program
twice you will get programs running at the same time, which
is fine but probably not what you want.


In Linux you may have to give the application execute
permissions first. You can you do that my right clicking
at the application file and selecting 'Properties' and
in the Dialog that appears you should be able to set
the file as executable.
